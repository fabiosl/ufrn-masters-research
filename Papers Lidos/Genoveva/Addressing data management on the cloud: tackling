Addressing data management on the cloud: tackling the big data challenges: http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1087/keynote4.pdf

My own words:

In this paper Genoveva talks about Big Data, Poliglot Persistence and proposes ExSchema: "an automated approach and its implementation to discover data schemas from polyglot persistence applications, based on source code analysis techniques".

The reason why ExSchema would be valid is because of the "schemaless-ness" of new polyglot persistence apps, where the developer doesn't always have a fixed schema to analyze, so the source code becomes the new Schema.

She also speaks about data-brokering: when someone has useful information and is able to sell it for others, just like the energy-broker example.
